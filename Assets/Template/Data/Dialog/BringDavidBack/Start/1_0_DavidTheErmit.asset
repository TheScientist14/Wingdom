  text: "Of course ! Actually if you want to help us, there is a hermit near the
    river that refuses to come live with us.\r\nWe know him really well and we all
    appreciate him, but he keeps living on his own. \r\nThat was not a problem when
    he was human, but now with this fairy appearance, it must be pretty hard to live
    for him. \r\nCan you try to reason with him please ?\r"
